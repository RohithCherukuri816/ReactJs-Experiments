## Experiment 15: Mini Project + Deployment (CO2, CO3, CO4, CO5, CO6, CO7)

Build a small app (choose one): ToDo App / Weather App / Student Directory.

### Objectives
- Use props and state
- Apply conditional rendering and list rendering
- Handle form input
- Optional: integrate an API
- Deploy on Netlify or Vercel

### Suggested Features
- ToDo: add, toggle complete, delete, filter by status
- Weather: search city, show current weather via API, loading/error states
- Student Directory: add students, list, search/filter

### High-Level Steps
1. Scaffold feature components and state structure.
2. Implement core CRUD interactions.
3. Add conditional UI (empty states, loading, error).
4. Extract presentational components; pass data via props.
5. Optional: integrate API (OpenWeather/JSONPlaceholder).
6. Build and deploy:
   - Netlify: push to Git, connect repo, set build command and publish dir.
   - Vercel: `vercel` CLI or connect Git repo and deploy from dashboard.

### How to Run Locally
- `npm start` (CRA) or `npm run dev` (Vite)

### Deployment Notes
- CRA publish dir: `build` after `npm run build`
- Vite publish dir: `dist` after `npm run build`
- Configure environment variables for APIs in the platform dashboard if needed.

### Learning Outcomes
- Combine core React skills into a cohesive app and deploy it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
